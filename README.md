# BookBot (Python)

**BookBot** is a Python script that analyzes the contents of a `.txt` file (like a book) and generates a report showing:
- Total word count
- Total letter count
- Frequency of each letter (case-insensitive)

This was my **first guided project** on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev), where I was given general instructions and goals — but had to write the code logic myself to make it all work. It challenged me to think through the structure, logic, and debugging process from start to finish.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** (loops, string methods, dictionaries)
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- **Git & GitHub** (version control and project sharing)

---

### What I Learned:
- Reading and parsing `.txt` files in Python
- Counting letters and words using dictionaries
- Building functions and structuring Python scripts
- Debugging and interpreting vague instructions
- Using GitHub to share and document my work

---

This project gave me hands-on experience with core programming concepts and helped me develop confidence solving problems independently.

*To try it out, place a `.txt` book file in the project folder and run the script — BookBot will generate a simple text report.*
